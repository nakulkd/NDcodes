## Speed Review Calculator

**Goal:** Create a tool which calculates the actual time required to watch a video when run at a faster pace (ex: 1.25x, 1.5x, etc...).

**Purpose:** To support students leveraging MOOCs to enhance their pace of learning while keeping a minimal impact to quality of learning.

**Future Development:**
* Take user input on time available and video/course length to suggest an appropriate pacing
* Expand user input to factor more constraints (ex: factor time spent on homeworks, assignments, quizzes, etc.)
